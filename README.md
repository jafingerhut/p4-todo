# Introduction

This repository is intended for me (Andy Fingerhut) to use Github
Issues to track [some
issues](https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-todo/issues) related to
open source development on projects of P4.org in the github.com/p4lang
organization.  Feel free to participate in any of these ways:

+ Create new issues.
+ Close issues that have been done, with links to the pull request(s)
  that caused them to be completed.
+ Comment on existing issues, e.g. mention you would like to
  volunteer to help, or add more details on how the issue might be
  completed.
